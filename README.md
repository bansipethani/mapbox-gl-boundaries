A Mapbox GL JS plugin that modifies the disputed boundaries in your map.

### Features
- Add claimed boundaries to a country with disputed territories for a local representation of the borders.

### Usage
Download the files from `dist/` and include it in your map html `<head>` with:

```
<script src='mapbox-gl-boundaries.js'></script>
```

In your `<script>` add this line after initializing your `map`:
```
mapboxgl.addClaimedBoundaries(map, 'IN'); // Add the claimed boundaries to the map of India
```
**Note** Currently only India is supported. For Mapbox Studio Classic styles, see [instructions for fixing the India border](https://gist.github.com/planemad/bab2795da23be8bf7006).
